# "handlers" specifies a comma separated list of log Handler 
# classes. These handlers will be installed during VM startup.

# Default global logging level.
# This specifies which kinds of events are logged across
# all loggers. For any given facility this global level
# can be overriden by a facility-specific level.
# Note that the ConsoleHandler also has a separate level
# setting to limit messages printed to the console.

    .level= INFO

# Limit the messages that are printed on the console to INFO and above.
