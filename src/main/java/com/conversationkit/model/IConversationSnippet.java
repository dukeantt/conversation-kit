 * A conversation snippet represents a small bit of dialog in a conversation.
 * In the case of a chat bot, this might represent a block of text sent as one
 * message. Snippets can be classified as a <code>STATEMENT</code> 
 * or <code>QUESTION</code>. Generally, if the snippet is a 
 * <code>STATEMENT</code> the conversation will proceed to the next 
 * automatically. If it is a <code>QUESTION</code>, the conversation will 
 * stop and wait for a response from the user. However, this depends on 
 * the <code>IConversationEngine</code> implementation.
 * <p>
 * Conversation snippets can also suggest possible responses. Some chat bot
 * clients like Facebook Messenger support displaying suggested responses in 
 * the interface while others like Slack do not.
